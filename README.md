# SQL_Employee_Database

This analysis involves employees at Pewlett Hackard from the 1980s and 1990s. Tables were designed to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data.

After uploadeding the data and performed multiple queries, some of the data was proved to be fabricated. I was able to find an employee with the name "April Foolsday"
